#Number 1.1
#Calculte arithmetic and logarethimic returns add as columns 
#AR = (Pt-Pt-1)/Pt-1 
#L = log(Pt/Pt-1)

#Number 1.2
#Sum daily returns 
#sum(col_AR)

#Compare results 

#Number 2
#Run linear regression with statsmodel.apiOLS with t-1 and t-2
#R = B0 + B1*Pt-1 + B2*Pt-2 + E 

#Coefficients should be zero due to EMH

#Number 3.1
#Fit normal distribution with stas.norm.fit func

#Number 3.2 
#Compute moments 1-4 Mean, Variance, Sknewness, Kurtosis
#Save u and sigma2 to later use 

#Number 3.3
#Second moment COV matrix
#1 Matrix for 5 stocks

#Number 3.4
#Previously saved mu and sigman 
a=np.random.normal(mu, sigma, 10000)

#Compute 3rd and 4th moment 

#Comment on normal distribution compare to 3.3

#Number 4
#Split date into 5 and run (maybe make a function out of 3 to save time on 4) 

#Number 5
#Write function for 2nd, 3rd and 4th moment
